Description: This package provides a collection of functions that may be used to compute a variety of improved shrinkage estimators in the area of statistical analysis. The package includes the following estimators: unrestricted; restricted; preliminary test; improved preliminary test; Stein; and positive-rule Stein. This package is based on the work found in chapter 7 of Saleh, A. K. Md. E. (2006). Theory of Preliminary Test and Stein‐Type Estimation With Applications, Wiley.
