\title{Hald's Cement Data}
\format{
A data.frame with 13 observations on the following 5 variables.
\describe{
  \item{x1}{percentage weight in clinkers of 3CaO.Al2O3}
  \item{x2}{percentage weight in clinkers of 3CaO.SiO2}
  \item{x3}{percentage weight in clinkers of 4CaO.Al2O3.Fe2O3}
  \item{x4}{percentage weight in clinkers of 2CaO.SiO2}
  \item{y}{heat evolved (calories/gram)}
}

\description{
Heat evolved in setting of cement, as a function of its chemical composition.

\details{
cement is taken from an example in Little & Rubin's book on
Statistical Analysis with Missing Data (2002), pp.~154,
for demonstrating estimation of multivariate means and variances
when the missing data pattern is monotone.
